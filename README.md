# Environment State (proof of concept)

The purpose of this repository is to represent current state of apps (versions, configs, etc.) in all environments.

# TODO

- Automate adding new apps by using a templates from "_templates" subdirectory.
- Change pipelines so they do something useful (helm release) instead of echo.
- Declare other materials for apps (ECR repo, docker image tag, git repo with the apps source code)
